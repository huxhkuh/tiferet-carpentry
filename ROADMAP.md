# Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-09-10
> Current app version: v5.32.0
> Next release target: v5.33.0
> Strategy: best-in-class, local-first, production-grade woodworking planning platform

## Current implementation status

The September audit and local remediation take precedence over aspirational feature claims below:
[audit and action plan](docs/audits/2026-09-09/AUDIT-AND-ACTION-PLAN.he.md),
[implementation and verification](docs/audits/2026-09-09/REMEDIATION.he.md), and
[tracked backlog](docs/audits/2026-09-09/ACTION-BACKLOG.csv).

The immediate product is a Hebrew apartment planning tool that produces a consistent preliminary
specification for a carpenter. Manufacturing validation, measured architectural geometry, actual
supplier prices and a business contact destination are separate acceptance requirements. Existing
sample prices and generic G-code are not a verified quotation or a machine-qualified production program.

Local remediation does not change the published version or imply a deployment.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This is a **living decision ledger** — not a sprint backlog.
Every major engineering, product, and tooling decision is re-opened, evaluated, and either confirmed with rationale or upgraded with a clear migration path.

## 2. Product North Star

**Build the most reliable local-first cabinet and furniture planning application that a real woodworker can trust in the workshop.**

### Core Pillars

| Pillar                       | Meaning                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deterministic geometry**   | Same inputs always produce same cuts, same part lists, same assembly sequence       |
| **Manufacturing confidence** | Export outputs (PDF, DXF, G-code) are contract-tested and match physical materials  |
| **Instant authoring**        | Multi-cabinet projects configure in seconds with live visual feedback               |
| **Universal access**         | WCAG 2.2 AA, full RTL (Hebrew, Arabic), 6 locales, keyboard-first, mobile-ready     |
| **Zero-compromise quality**  | No lint suppressions, no type hacks, no dead code — production discipline at scale  |
| **Offline-first**            | No server required. All computation client-side. Optional cloud is strictly adapter |

### Non-Goals (Intentional Exclusions)

- 3D solid modeling (leave to Fusion 360 / FreeCAD)
- CNC post-processor library (we generate safe G-code, not machine-specific posts)
- Cloud-mandatory workflows (everything works offline; cloud is opt-in sync only)
- Payment/subscription infrastructure (MIT open-source, no monetization layer)

### Key Takeaways From Comparison

1. **Parametric expressions**: Fusion 360 and PolyBoard allow formula-based dimensions. We should add a named-expression system for power users.
2. **Optimization depth**: Cabinet Vision supports grain direction, edge banding, and multi-stock. Our MaxRects can add grain-aware rotation and multi-material strategies.
3. **Output contracts**: We already lead in contract testing but should add per-format schema versioning headers.
4. **Our unique edge**: Accessibility + RTL + offline + free + open-source. No competitor matches all four.
5. **Assembly animations**: Fusion 360's timeline is the gold standard — we can approximate with step-by-step SVG sequences.
6. **Community data**: OpenCutList's plugin model for materials is worth emulating with importable JSON catalogs.

## 6. Production Readiness Gates (Blocking)

All release candidates must pass every gate before tagging:

| Gate             | Command                          | Threshold                          |

## 9. Repository Structure Policy

```text
/ (root)
├── Tool configs only: vite.config.ts, eslint.config.js, tsconfig*.json, etc.
├── Project essentials: package.json, index.html, README.md, ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md
├── config/         Budget files, schema definitions, sync manifests
├── docs/           Architecture, user guide, sprint history, API docs
├── public/         Static assets served as-is (manifest, fonts, SVGs)
├── scripts/        Build/CI helper scripts (Node.js)
├── src/            Application source code
├── tests/          All test files mirroring src/
└── .github/        CI, agents, prompts, instructions, actions
```

Rules:

- No intermediate/generated files in workspace — all go to `$TEMP/WoodworkingShop/`
- No new root files without explicit justification in this document
- Dead files caught by `npm run dead:check` (Knip)
- Template assets synced to parent `MyScripts/templates/` via `npm run template:sync`

---

## 10. Execution Backlog

5. ~~Component budget exceptions policy~~ — DONE

### Next (v5.31.0)

1. Add docs ownership file and freshness validation
2. Add release readiness report generator
3. Add React Error Boundaries per panel
4. Add import validation with JSON Schema
5. Grain-aware cut optimization (rotation constraint)

### Future (v5.32.0+)

1. Named parametric expressions system
2. OPFS persistence migration
3. Visual regression testing pipeline
4. Project template library (kitchen, bathroom, closet)
5. Batch ZIP export (all cabinets, all formats)
6. OpenSSF Scorecard badge (≥7.0)
7. Plugin API public documentation
8. Multi-material optimizer strategy

---

## 11. Definition of Done

The project achieves best-in-class status when:

- All production readiness gates pass on every commit (CI enforced)
- Export outputs are contract-tested with golden fixtures across all formats
- Accessibility and 6-locale i18n are continuously validated
- Governance automation prevents silent drift in code, docs, AI assets, and workflows
- Parent MyScripts template receives validated governance baseline
- Zero suppression policy has zero exceptions (no eslint-disable, no ts-ignore, no as any)
- OpenSSF Scorecard ≥ 7.0
- All comparison-table gaps from Section 4 are addressed or explicitly deferred with rationale
